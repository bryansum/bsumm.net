In a phrase, a man with higher aspirations. I'm a 2010 graduate of the University of Michigan in the CS program, currently working at Amazon.com in Seattle as a software engineer.

At some point I'd like to use [Twitter](http://twitter.com/bsummersett) more often. Some programming examples are located on [Github](http://github.com/bryansum). Feel free to [email me](mailto:&#x62;&#x73;&#x75;&#x6D;&#x6D;&#x65;&#x72;&#x73;&#x65;&#x74;&#x74;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) as well.
