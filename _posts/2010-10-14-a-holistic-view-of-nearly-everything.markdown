Finding connections between disciplines fascinates me, like the similarities between [work habits of hackers and painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html). Time spent studing unrelated fields to one's curriculum is rarely wasted; although its benefits aren't always immediately realized, gaining perspective can lead to many long-term benefits. Lateral thinking and creativity depend on the ability to adapt processes and metaphors to something else. Regarding an ideal university experience, I remain an advocate for hard science and engineering majors investing substantial time in studying humanties.

Analytical and procedural thinking are requisites for any successful computer scientist, but the truly innovative are able to call on a wide breadth of knowledge when needed. This can have surprising results. [John Holland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland) took the idea of gene replication and adapted it into a well-known algorithm. Alan Kay, trained as a biologist, took the idea of cellular processes as the basis for object-oriented programming: encapsulation serving as an analogue to the cell wall, and signaling between the cells representing something akin to message passing. Regarding business decisions, understanding the incentives of your customer and the job to be done has more to do with empathizing with your users than fulfilling a bullet list, which no amount of quantitative reasoning can wholly solve (c.f., Google). This realization has led to technology companies increasingly emphasizing interaction design in product development, which in turn has its roots in HCI and psychology. Systems thinking, now commonly applied in business development, was largely inspired by the work of Donella Meadows, an environmental scientist who wrote 1972's the [The Limits of Growth](http://www.amazon.com/Limits-Growth-30-year-Update/dp/184407143X), a study of how exponential processes interact with finite resources with a focus on Earth's natural resources. (Another one of her books, [Thinking in Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557), remains a favorite read of mine as a beginner's guide to sytems thinking.)

Breadth in thinking, to me, means reading widely, critically, and then more deeply in fields one finds most interesting. This skill, "learning how to learn," is one of the tenants of a liberal arts education, but tends to be glossed over during a typical engineer's undergraduate education. I would hope that over time, more engineers and technologists-cum-entrepreneurs give themselves time to really explore more of these seemingly unrelated fields, if nothing but for perspectives' sake.
