I picked up some great records already at [Zion's Gate](http://zionsgate.com)
and [Half-Price Books](http://www.halfpricebooks.com/). I have a feeling finding
good music is going to be pretty easy here. Here's what I picked up:

* [Big Audio Dynamite - P-Funk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Punk)
* [Circle Jerks - Group Sex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Sex)
* Burning Spear - S/T
* [The Heptones - Party Time](http://www.amazon.com/Party-Time-Heptones/dp/B00009ATJK)
