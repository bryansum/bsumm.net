Happy new year everyone!

I'm in the middle of redesigning the site. I'd like to increase the activity
level of the site as there are a few projects I've been working on 
which need a home online. One is [iJam](/projects/ijam), a 
mobile music app for the iPhone that I and a
few others are working on. We hope to have it out sometime in the spring. It 
uses another library called [pdlib](/projects/pdlib) which I'm excited to be
able to share with other developers.
