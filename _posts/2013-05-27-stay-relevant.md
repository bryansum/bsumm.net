2005 M.I.A Pitchfork [interview](http://web.archive.org/web/20050317044856/www.pitchforkmedia.com/interviews/m/mia-05/), describing the circumstances of her first album:
> M.I.A.: The thing that I got exposed to when I met Justine was a lot of middle-class kids making music in England who had everything at their disposal and nothing to say. They didn't rep anything! Yet everybody was having soul-searching issues going, "Oh my Goooooood, who am I, what am I doing? I might have to go to a yoga retreat this year." And I'd be like, "Why don't you just look at what's going on and be a part of the planet, instead of wanting to be what's come before?" Which is how all those bands set themselves up-- they aspired to be [older] bands and forget what's going on [today]."
