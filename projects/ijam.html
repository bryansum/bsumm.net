		<p>iJam was created to lower the barrier to entry for collaborating musically with others.
People are often unable to do so for a number of reasons. People:</p>

<ul>
<li>typically need to be in the same room</li>
<li>can't afford instruments</li>
<li>can't relocate instruments easily (e.g., drums)</li>
<li>lack the technical expertise to set up existing systems</li>
</ul>


<p>iJam is a mobile application for the iPhone which facilitates networked, collaborative
music making via musical "sessions." Users can play either play an instrument
by themselves or "share" playing an instrument. Either way, this is then heard
by all members of the session. It features multiple virtual instruments
playable via multi-touch and gesture-based input mechanisms (accelerometer, etc).
iJam is designed to make it effortless to quickly collaborate with others.</p>

<p>To start, a player can either create a new
session or join an existing one. Sessions can be configured to be Wifi-based
or Bluetooth-based, with both using Apple's Bonjour service to broadcast their presence.</p>

<p>From here, the user can select from (currently) a few instruments, including
<em>drumelectro</em>, <em>rhodeybass</em>, and <em>metronome</em>. These are synthesized using
<a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html">Pure Data</a> software. iJam uses this
extensively for its audio back end, and Pure Data's port to the iPhone is available
as the open-sourced <a href="/projects/pdlib">pdlib</a> on this site.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ij-drums.png" alt="Figure 2: iJam simplistic 'drumelectro' interface. Drums are movable. Note the timeline above." /></p>

<p>iJam can currently be used in two different "modes": <em>sequenced</em> or <em>free-form</em>.
The two modes can be toggled by selecting the red record button on the
options pane for the instrument. When in <em>sequenced</em> mode, all notes
played are recorded on the timeline and played back on all future iterations
of the loop unless the timeline is cleared.</p>

<p>Currently iJam requires a server with Ross Bencina's
<a href="http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/code/oscgroups/">oscgroups</a>
server software to be running on a local machine, but this will be integrated
into the host iPhone in the future (this allows for completely serverless
session creation).
Once connected, clients use UDP multicasting to send <a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org/">OSC</a>
messages directly to other session participants.</p>

<p>I've been working on the project as part of my senior design class, and
plan on continuing work throughout the Winter 2010 semester.
My group and I are on target to have iJam available on the App Store in Spring 2010.
Subscribe to my blog if you're interested in its development.</p>
